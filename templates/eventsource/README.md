# Cloudstate Service

The following assumes that you have completed the steps for setting up your local environment as well as creating an account and project.  If you have not done this you must follow the instructions here:

* [Setting Up your Machine](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/setup.html)
   * as well as the [Developer prerequisites](https://docs.lbcs.dev/developing/developing.html#prerequisites)
   * You also need to install the protobuf compiler.
* [Your Lightbend Cloudstate Account](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/account.html)
* [Creating a Project](https://docs.lbcs.dev/gettingstarted/project.html)

## Layout
* Source code `js` and `proto` files are in this directory
* A `deploy` directory that contains the deployment yaml files.


### Storage Setup
* Modify `deploy/postgres-store.yaml`
    * Uniquify the store `name`
* Modify js-shopping-cart.yaml to match
*   Change `spec|storeConfig|statefulStore|name` to match the name used above

## Building 

### Deployment
```bash
cd deploy
kubectl apply -f . -n <project-name>
# To Verify
kubectl -n <project-name>  get statefulservices
NAME            REPLICAS   STATUS
my-service      1          Ready
```

To verify the statefulstore use the following:
```bash
kubectl get statefulstore -n <project-name>
NAME                  AGE
my-postgres           21m
```

To access the front end chat interface open a web browser and navigate to:

`https://<project-name>.us-east1.apps.lbcs.dev/pages/index.html`

If you would like to make changes and build the application, please follow the
instructions in the section below.

## Building and deploying your service
```
npm install
npm run prestart

```

This will compile the protobuf and `user-function.desc`
Build a docker image with the right registry and tag
```
docker build . -t <my-registry>/my-service:latest
```

Push the docker image to the registry
```
docker push <my-registry>/my-service:latest
```

Deploy the image by changing into the deploy folder and editing the `my-service.yaml` to point to your docker image that you just pushed.
```
cd ../deploy
cat my-service.yaml
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: StatefulService
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  containers:
  - image: coreyauger/my-service:latest    # <-- Change this to your image
    name: my-service
```

Deploy the service to your project namespace
```
kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml -n <project-name>
statefulservice.cloudstate.io/my-service created
````

### Verify they are running
Check that the service is running
```
kubectl get statefulservices -n <project-name>
NAME             REPLICAS   STATUS
my-service       1          Ready
```

To redeploy a new image to the cluster you must delete and then redeploy using the yaml file.  
For example if we updated the shopping-cart docker image we would do the following.
````
kubectl delete statefulservice my-service -n <project-name>
statefulservice.cloudstate.io "my-service" deleted
kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml -n <project-name>    
statefulservice.cloudstate.io/my-service created
````

## Routes
The last thing that is required is to provide the public routes needed for both the front end and grpc-web calls.  These exist in the `routes.yaml` file.

```
cat routes.yaml
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: "my-routes"
spec:
  http:
  - name: "my-routes"
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/"
    route:
      service: my-service     
```

Add these routes by performing
```
kubectl apply -f routes.yaml -n <project-name>
```

The web url that will resolve the above route it:

`https://<project-name>.us-east1.apps.lbcs.dev/`
